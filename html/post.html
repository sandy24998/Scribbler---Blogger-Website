                Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.[1] Hendrix
                expanded
                the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. His
                boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as distortion forever
                transformed the sound of rock and roll. While creating his unique musical voice and guitar style,
                Hendrix
                synthesized diverse genres, including blues, R&B, soul, British rock, American folk music, 1950s rock
                and
                roll, psychedelic and jazz. Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain.[119] He
                was
                instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback, and
                helped to
                popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock.[348] He rejected the standard barre chord
                fretting
                technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th string root notes with his
                thumb.[349]
                He applied this technique during the beginning bars of "Little Wing", which allowed him to sustain the
                root
                note of chords while also playing melody. This method has been described as piano style, with the thumb
                playing what a pianist's left hand would play and the other fingers playing melody as a right
                hand.[350]
                Having spent several years fronting a trio, he developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead
                lines
                together, giving the audio impression that more than one guitarist was performing.[351][nb 41] He was
                the
                first artist to incorporate stereophonic phasing effects in rock music recordings.[354] Holly
                George-Warren
                of Rolling Stone commented: "Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source.
                Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and
                others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he
                began."[3][nb
                42] Aledort wrote: "In rock guitar, there are but two eras ï¿½ before Hendrix and after Hendrix."
